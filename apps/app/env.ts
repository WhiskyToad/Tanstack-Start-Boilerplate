   * By default, this library will feed the environment variables directly to
   * the Zod validator.
   *
   * This means that if you have an empty string for a value that is supposed
   * to be a number (e.g. `PORT=` in a ".env" file), Zod will incorrectly flag
   * it as a type mismatch violation. Additionally, if you have an empty string
   * for a value that is supposed to be a string with a default value (e.g.
   * `DOMAIN=` in an ".env" file), the default value will never be applied.
   *
   * In order to solve these issues, we recommend that all new projects
   * explicitly specify this option as true.
